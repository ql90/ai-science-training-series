Large Language Models (LLMs) enable computers to understand articles by analyzing the relationships between words and sentences. By training computers on a vast amount of biologically or chemically relevant literature, LLMs can suggest novel artificial products based on existing biological or chemical knowledge. For instance, LLMs could propose plant cell modifications to extend their lifespan, addressing issues related to crop preservation. Alternatively, they could recommend the synthesis of chemically stable building materials to enhance the fire and corrosion resistance of construction materials.
